# Clean-WhatsApp-Cache
Develop a project to clean the WhatsApp cache, aiming to improve the application's performance and increase execution speed. The project will involve creating a script or application to safely identify and remove unnecessary cache data without affecting important user conversations or data. Additionally, the project should include a simple user interface for ease of use, and tests to ensure WhatsApp's performance is significantly improved after the cache is cleared.
